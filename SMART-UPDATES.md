## Smart Update System for TaskQuest

The TaskQuest application now includes a **Smart Update System** that prevents real-time updates from interrupting users while they are actively typing or editing content.

### How It Works

1. **Detects User Interaction**: The system continuously monitors if any input fields (textareas, input fields, selects) are currently focused and being used.

2. **Defers Updates**: When a real-time update comes in (via socket.io) while a user is typing, the update is deferred instead of executed immediately.

3. **Preserves State**: Before any update, the system saves the current state of all input fields including:
   - Current value
   - Cursor position
   - Selection range
   - Focus state
   - Scroll position

4. **Restores State**: After an update is applied, the system restores all input states, ensuring users don't lose their work or cursor position.

5. **Executes Deferred Updates**: When the user stops typing (detected after 1 second of inactivity), all pending updates are executed automatically.

### Key Features

- **Non-Intrusive**: Real-time updates continue to work, but don't interrupt active users
- **State Preservation**: Cursor position, selections, and content are preserved during updates
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old deferred updates are cleaned up to prevent memory issues
- **Force Execute**: Critical updates can be forced if needed
- **Universal**: Works with all input types (text, textarea, select, contenteditable)

### Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: No more losing text or cursor position during typing
- **Maintains Real-Time Feel**: Updates still happen quickly when users aren't actively typing
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prevents the frustrating "text field reset" issue in collaborative environments
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, only active when needed

### Technical Implementation

The system is implemented in `modules/smart-updates.js` and integrated into the main application via:

- Socket.io update handlers
- Form submission callbacks
- Task rendering functions

The system automatically detects when users are:
- Typing in task notes
- Editing personal notes
- Filling out forms
- Using any input field

This ensures that collaborative real-time updates don't interfere with individual user workflows while maintaining the responsive feel of the application.
